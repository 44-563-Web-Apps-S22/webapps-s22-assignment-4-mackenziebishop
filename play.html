        <h3> 
            Act 4  
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Two young people, Henriette and Clitandre, are in love, but in order to marry, they must overcome an obstacle: 
            the attitude of Henriette's family. Her sensible father and uncle are in favour of the marriage; but unfortunately her 
            father is under the thumb of his wife, Philaminte. And Philaminte, supported by Henriette's aunt and sister, wishes her 
            to marry Trissotin, a "scholar" and mediocre poet with lofty aspirations, who has these three women completely in his thrall. 
            For these three ladies are "learned"; their obsession in life is learning and culture of the most pretentious kind, and 
            Trissotin is their special protégé and the fixture of their literary salon.

                Yes, there was no hesitation in her; she made a display of her
                obedience, and her heart scarcely took time to hear the order. She
                seemed less to obey the will of her father than affect to set at
                defiance the will of her mother.

                I will soon show her to which of us two the laws of reason
                subject her wishes, and who ought to govern, mother or father, mind or

                At least, they owed you the compliment of consulting you; and
                that little gentleman who resolves to become your son-in-law, in spite
                of yourself, behaves himself strangely.

                He has not yet reached the goal of his desires. I thought him
                well made, and approved of your love; but his manners were always
                unpleasant to me. He knows that I write a little, thank heaven, and
                yet he has never desired me to read anything to him.

                If I were you, I would not allow him to become Henriette's
                husband. It would be wrong to impute to me the least thought of
                speaking like an interested person in this matter, and false to think
                that the base trick he is playing me secretly vexes me. By the help of
                philosophy, my soul is fortified against such trials; by it we can
                rise above everything. But to see him treat you so, provokes me beyond
                all endurance. Honour requires you to resist his wishes, and he is not
                a man in whom you could find pleasure. In our talks together I never
                could see that he had in his heart any respect for you.

                praising you.
